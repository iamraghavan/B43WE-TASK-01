HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. 
It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands.

Over the years, HTTP has undergone several revisions to improve its performance and functionality. 
The two most widely used versions of HTTP in current use are HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

HTTP/1.1 is the previous version of HTTP and has been in use since 1999. 
It is a text-based protocol and uses a single, persistent connection for all requests and responses. 
It also has a limitation of handling only one request at a time, which leads to latency issues and slow page loading times.

On the other hand, HTTP/2 is the latest version of HTTP and was released in 2015. 
It is a binary protocol, which means it uses a more efficient format for transferring data. 
It also uses multiplexing, which allows the browser to send multiple requests and receive multiple responses at the same time over a single connection. This feature improves the performance of web pages by reducing latency and allows for faster page loading times.

HTTP/2 also includes other features such as server push, 
which allows the server to proactively send resources to the browser, and header compression, 
which reduces the size of headers in HTTP requests and responses.

In summary, HTTP/1.1 is a text-based protocol that uses a single connection for requests and responses and can handle only one request at a time, 
while HTTP/2 is a binary protocol that uses multiplexing, server push, and header compression to improve performance and reduce latency. 
The latest version of HTTP is always recommended for better performance and functionality.

It is important to note that to take advantage of the benefits of HTTP/2, a website must be served over 
HTTPS (HTTP Secure) as it is not supported over unencrypted HTTP.
