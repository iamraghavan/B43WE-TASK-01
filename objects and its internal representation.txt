Javascript, as a programming language, provides a built-in support for working with objects. 
Objects in Javascript are used to store collections of data, and they can be used to model real-world objects or entities. In Javascript, an object is an unordered collection of properties, 
each of which has a name and a value.

In Javascript, objects are represented internally as a hash table, 
also known as a dictionary or associative array. 
A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to values. 
In the case of Javascript objects, the keys are the property names, 
and the values are the property values.

When an object is created, the properties and their values are added to the hash table. 
When a property of an object is accessed, the hash table is searched for the key that corresponds to the property name. 
The corresponding value is then returned.

Javascript objects also have a prototype, which is an object that is used as a template for creating new objects. When a property is accessed on an object, Javascript first checks the object's own properties. If the property is not found, it then checks the object's prototype, 
and the process continues until the property is found or the prototype chain ends.

Objects in Javascript are also mutable, which means their properties can be added, 
modified, or removed at any time. When a property is added or modified, 
the hash table is updated accordingly.

In conclusion, objects in Javascript are collections of properties, 
each of which has a name and a value. They are internally represented as a hash table, 
and they have a prototype that is used as a template for creating new objects. Additionally, 
objects in javascript are mutable, meaning their properties can be added, modified, 
or removed at any time. Understanding the internal representation of objects in Javascript can help developers to write more efficient and performant code.
